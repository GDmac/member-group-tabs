Member Group Tabs
=================

The Problem
-----------

Tabs that are created in the ExpressionEngine Main Menu Manager are on a per member basis. It is time consuming when you want to create the same tab for a number of members. **This extension allows you to create navigation tabs for member groups in the ExpressionEngine control panel.** New and existing members will have access to tabs that are created for their member group.

Installation
------------

1. Unpackage the zip file
2. Place 'sh\_member\_group_tabs' folder in your 'system/expressionengine/third\_party' directory
3. Enable the 'Member Group Tabs' extension in the ExpressionEngine control panel by navigating to Modules > Extensions

Usage
-----

In the ExpressionEngine control panel navigate to Modules > Extensions and click Member Group Tabs 'Settings'.

The Member Group Tabs settings page will list member groups that have control panel permissions.

### Quick Notes

* Created member group tabs will appear in-between ExpressionEngine's default buttons, and the default member tabs.

* Tabs can be rearranged by selecting, and dragging up or down.
* The 'Tab URL' field can contain a relative or absolute URL.
* External URLs are automatically masked to protect the location of your system path from server logs.
